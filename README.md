# Pear Backend

To start Pear Backend, run `npm install` and `npm run start`.

Pear Backend requires a `.envrc` file which is outlined in `.envrctemplate`. Additionally, PostgreSQL is used for the database. The configuration for this database should be included in the `.envrc` file.

Pear Backend has a linter which can be used with `npm run check` to view issues, and `npm run fix` to auto-fix some of those issues.

Documentation on routes and usage is [here](http://pear-backend.cornellappdev.com/api/v1/docs/).
